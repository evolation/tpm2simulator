.SH NAME
tssimaextend \- Replay the IMA event log
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Replays the provided IMA event log.
.PP
Without \fB\-sim\fR, uses TPM2_PCR_Extend to extend the events into the TPM.
.br
With    \fB\-sim\fR, extends into simulated PCRs and traces the result.
.PP
Without \fB\-sim\fR, hash algorithms not allocated are ignored, the TPM behavior.
.br
With    \fB\-sim\fR, all specified hash algorithms are used.
If no hash algorithms are specified, defaults to sha1 and sha256.
.PP
Two IMA log formats are currently supported:
.PP
1: SHA1 \- A zero padded measurement is extended into other PCR banks.
.br
2: SHA1 \- A digest of the template data is extended into other PCR banks.
.PP
This handles the case where a zero measurement extends ones into the IMA PCR.
.TP
\fB\-if\fR
IMA event log file name
.TP
[\-of
With \fB\-sim\fR, PCR 10 of first algorithm specified]
.TP
[\-le
input file is little endian (default big endian)]
.TP
[\-halg
(sha1, sha256, sha384, sha512)]
.br
\fB\-halg\fR may be specified more than once
.TP
[\-ty
IMA log format (default type 1)]
.TP
[\-tpm
extend TPM PCRs (default)]
.TP
[\-sim
calculate simulated PCRs]
.TP
[\-checkhash
verify IMA event log hashes]
.TP
[\-b
beginning entry (default 0, beginning of log)]
A beginning entry after the end of the log becomes a noop
.TP
[\-e
ending entry (default end of log)]
E.g., \fB\-b\fR 0 \fB\-e\fR 0 sends one entry
.TP
[\-l
time \- run in a continuous loop, sleep 'time' seconds betwteen loops]
The intent is that this be run without specifying \fB\-b\fR and \fB\-e\fR
Afer each pass, the next beginning entry is set to the last entry +1
